# ByteCoin-io
From Udemy.... but updated by me


Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

Most Crypto icons: Designed by Freepik.

Images by Udemy.

Currency Icons and some Crypto Icons are desgined by me.

The code is based on the Default template from Udemy.

Then code was added in line with the course.

After this I did play (as practice)  a bit with it to make it more interresting.

I might carry on...

How I did create the 'pdf' since I di not want to use the 'online' solution.

I use Inkscape on my mac. 
One file with all my 'icons' saved as 'svg' 
Select one object only, copy and paste in a new file.
In the new file select the object then select 'save as' and choose 'pdf'
in the window select object not the whole file.
save.
You can close the file. No need to save.

Now you repeat for every object you want to use as vector.

Works pretty well and it is free.
